## Motivation

This page serves as a guide for developers who wish to run their dApp entirely locally, while still using some NEAR offerings like the NEAR Wallet and NEAR Explorer.

**Disclaimer**: this process has not been Dockerized or otherwise put into a configuration system yet. Hence, this guide will go through all the steps one by one, serving as a rough method to get a local environment going. As always, the community is welcome to help streamline this process, and all are welcome to submit pull requests to enhance this experience. We appreciate all contributions!

### Prerequisites

- [Git](https://git-scm.com/book/en/v2/Getting-Started-Installing-Git)
- [Docker](https://docs.docker.com/get-docker/).
- NodeJS version 12+. We recommend using [a version manager](https://nodejs.org/en/download/package-manager/).
- [Python 3](https://www.python.org/download/releases/3.0/) and the [pip3 package](https://pip.pypa.io/en/stable/installing/)
- [Postgres](https://wiki.postgresql.org/wiki/Detailed_installation_guides)
- Rust (see instructions below)

### Get Rust

    curl --proto '=https' --tlsv1.2 -sSf https://sh.rustup.rs | sh

Also, [see the docs](https://docs.near.org/docs/tutorials/intro-to-rust#3-step-rust-installation) for more links and resources for installing Rust.

### Set up NEAR node

Clone the [nearcore repository](https://github.com/near/nearcore) with:

    git clone git@github.com:near/nearcore.git
    
**Note**: if you have not set up SSH access with git, please visit the repository link on Github and clone it using the links given in the interface, selecting "https" instead of "ssh". This will also apply to future steps in this guide. 
    
Navigate to the project root:

    cd nearcore
    
Build (this will take a while, feel free to move on to future steps while this is happening):

    make release

### Get and run `nearup`

When the NEAR node from the previous step has completed building, we'll use the `nearup` command line interface to start a local network.

**Note**: please reference the [README for nearup](https://github.com/near/nearup) for the most up to date instructions.

    pip3 install --user nearup

Verify that you local installation is in `~/.local/bin/nearup` by running:

    which nearup
    
If the above command says it's not found, please visit the linked README to resolve issues.
    
Finally, run the local network with:

    nearup run localnet --binary-path path/to/nearcore/target/release
    
This will spin up a "localnet" with a handful of accounts. Check out http://127.0.0.1:3030/status to see a JSON payload showing the status of the network. Note there are objects for the accounts:

- node0
- node1
- node2
- node3

In later steps we'll set up NEAR Contract Helper and NEAR Wallet. We'll be using information for the **node0** account. You may want to open `~/.near/localnet` and take a look at the contents.

That directory has this structure:

```
├── node0
│  ├── config.json
│  ├── data                 ⟵ directory
│  ├── genesis.json
│  ├── node_key.json
│  └── validator_key.json   ⟵ private key for node0
├── node1
… (same files and directories, etc.)
```

We'll be using the `validator_key.json` file a bit later.

### Postgres

Make sure Postgres is installed on your machine. The directions will vary per operating system and setup. As mentioned earlier, here is a link to [detailed installation guides](https://wiki.postgresql.org/wiki/Detailed_installation_guides).

Mac users may consider:

    brew install postgresql
    
and/or getting the [Postgres app](https://postgresapp.com/).

**Note**: it's worth double-checking [the README](https://github.com/near/near-contract-helper#create-database) for `near-contract-helper` if issues arise regarding the database.

Once Postgres is installed, type:

    psql
    
Make sure it takes you to a prompt. If it does not, please follow the directions given on screen. Once the prompt appears as expected you may exit with:

    \q

### NEAR Contract Helper

Clone the [NEAR Contract Helper repository](https://github.com/near/near-contract-helper)

    git clone git@github.com:near/near-contract-helper.git
    cd near-contract-helper

On your terminal / command prompt:

    psql

at the Postgres prompt:

    create user helper with superuser password 'helper';
    create database accounts_development with owner=helper;
    
Then:

    yarn migrate
    # or
    npm run migrate
    
Add a file named `.env` in the project root with these contents. We'll modify them later:

```dotenv
ACCOUNT_CREATOR_KEY={"account_id":"node0","public_key":"ed25519:7PGseFbWxvYVgZ89K1uTJKYoKetWs7BJtbyXDzfbAcqX","secret_key":"ed25519:3D4YudUQRE39Lc4JHghuB5WM8kbgDDa34mnrEP5DdTApVH81af7e2dWgNPEaiQfdJnZq1CNPp5im4Rg5b733oiMP"}
MAIL_HOST=smtp.ethereal.email
MAIL_PASSWORD=
MAIL_PORT=587
MAIL_USER=
NEW_ACCOUNT_AMOUNT=10000000000000000000000000
NODE_ENV=development # Node.js environment; either `development` or `production`
NODE_URL=http://127.0.0.1:3030 # from ~/.near/config.json#rpc.addr – for production, use https://rpc.testnet.near.org
PORT=3000 # Used internally by the contract helper; does not have to correspond to the external IP or DNS name and can link to a host machine running the Docker container
TWILIO_ACCOUNT_SID= # account SID from Twilio (used to send security code)
TWILIO_AUTH_TOKEN= # auth token from Twilio (used to send security code)
TWILIO_FROM_PHONE=+15553455 # phone number from which to send SMS with security code (international format, starting with `+`)
WALLET_URL=http://127.0.0.1:4000
INDEXER_DB_CONNECTION=postgres://helper:helper@127.0.0.1/near_indexer_for_wallet_localnet?ssl=require
```

We will be changing the first key in the list of environment variables (`ACCOUNT_CREATOR_KEY`) to be unique to your set up. Note that there are no spaces in that key, even after colons and commas. This is important to remember as we add in your local node's private key.

As mentioned earlier in the `nearup` section, we have the private key for the localnet account **node0**. With your preferred editor, open the file: 
 
    ~/.near/localnet/node0/validator_key.json
    
Remove all spaces and line breaks such that the private key exists on one line. (Also, see the example from the code block above.) Now replace the value for the key `ACCOUNT_CREATOR_KEY` with your private key.

Finally, start the NEAR Contract Helper with:

    npm run start
    
### NEAR CLI

Future steps will use the NEAR command-line interface tool to deploy and send NEAR tokens (Ⓝ) to an account. The CLI is capable of much more than that, as [documented here](https://docs.near.org/docs/development/near-cli).

Install with:

    npm i -g near-cli

### NEAR Linkdrop

There's a smart contract called Linkdrop that will need to be deployed to the `node0` account that was created automatically after starting the node in previous steps.

Clone the [NEAR Linkdrop](https://github.com/near/near-linkdrop) repository:

    git clone git@github.com:near/near-linkdrop.git
    cd near-linkdrop
    ./build.sh
    
We can see that there is no contract deployed to `node0` by observing the output of this command:

    NEAR_ENV=local near state node0

```
…
Account node0
{
  …
  code_hash: '11111111111111111111111111111111',
  …
}
```

The `code_hash` here of all 1's signals that there is no smart contract deployed to it.

Deploy the linkdrop contract with:

    NEAR_ENV=local near deploy --accountId node0 --wasmFile res/linkdrop.wasm --keyPath ~/.near/localnet/node0/validator_key.json

Now the contract has been deployed. Checking the state of the account (using the same command from before) will show the `code_hash` is now the has of the contract code.    

### NEAR Wallet

Clone the [NEAR Wallet](https://github.com/near/near-wallet) repository.

    git clone git@github.com:near/near-wallet.git
    cd near-wallet
    
Create a file in the project root called `.env.local` and paste the contents:

```dotenv
REACT_APP_ACCOUNT_HELPER_URL=http://localhost:3000
REACT_APP_ACCOUNT_ID_SUFFIX=node0
REACT_APP_IS_MAINNET=false
REACT_APP_NODE_URL=http://localhost:3030
REACT_APP_ACCESS_KEY_FUNDING_AMOUNT="3000000000000000000000000"
```

Then run this command:

    npm run update:static && node --max-http-header-size=16000 ./node_modules/.bin/parcel -p 4000 src/index.html
    
Open up the Wallet at http://127.0.0.1:4000

Follow the instructions in the interface to create an account. When asked to choose a recovery option, choose the **Email Recovery** option. When it asks for an email, enter this mock email:

    near@example.com
    
An email has not been sent, but it will appear in the logs of our Terminal tab running NEAR Contract Helper. Navigate to that tab and search for the email address. There will be a line close to that vicinity that says:

>Confirm your activation code to finish creating your account

Below there will appear a message like this:

```
…
'1. Confirm your activation code to finish creating your account:\n' +
    '154005\n' +
…
```

Copy the code (it's several digits, in the snippet above it would be `154005`) and use that to answer the prompt in Wallet for the activation code.

The next screen asks to fund an implicit account with at least 3 Ⓝ. Copy the address and
fund the account with NEAR CLI, replacing the long implicit account below with yours:

    NEAR_ENV=local near send node0 f81247b9492b80284fa2d90dc498153258a6f08e39db6cfa3356abb43a515432 500 --keyPath ~/.near/localnet/node0/validator_key.json

Expect to see your user "logged in" in the upper right part of the interface. A screen may ask if you'd like to enable two-factor authentication, but we'll leave the contract as-is.

### NEAR Explorer

Clone the [NEAR Explorer](https://github.com/near/near-explorer) repository with:

    git clone git@github.com:near/near-explorer.git
    cd near-explorer

We'll use Docker to run WAMP routing:

    docker-compose build wamp
    docker-compose up -d wamp
    
Then go into the `backend` directory and create a `db` subdirectory.

    cd backend
    npm install
    mkdir db
    
Start the backend with: 
    
    env NEAR_RPC_URL=http://127.0.0.1:3030 WAMP_NEAR_EXPLORER_URL=ws://localhost:8080/ws WAMP_NEAR_EXPLORER_BACKEND_SECRET=back npm run start
    
You can expect to see your screen show logs repeating these type of messages:

```
…
Starting regular data stats check from LEGACY_SYNC_BACKEND...
Regular data stats check from LEGACY_SYNC_BACKEND is completed.
Starting regular final timestamp check...
Regular final timestamp check is completed.
Starting regular node status check...
Regular node status check is completed.
…
```

Go into the `frontend` directory:

    cd ..
    cd frontend
    npm install
    
Start the frontend on port 3019:

    env WAMP_NEAR_EXPLORER_URL=ws://localhost:8080/ws ./node_modules/.bin/next -p 3019

Then visit the frontend at http://127.0.0.1:3019 

## Troubleshooting

If you are running into issues with your localnet, you may consider deleting the `~/.near/localnet` directory and running the `nearup` command again.

If you're running into issues while running Explorer with messages seem to be database related, try running the command a couple more times or until the same log messages appear after each run.

If Wallet seems to be acting up, and the console log shows messages about old accounts, you may try to clear the local storage. In the browser's developer console: 

    localStorage.clear()
